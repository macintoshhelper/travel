# travel
Open-source and decentralised travel platform for discovering new places and getting info on-the-go.

Work in progress, but the aim is to take JSON as an input, and output travel guides with markers in markdown, GeoJSON and an app.

## Features / Roadmap

- [ ] Location ID system
  Refer to cities, states and countries by human-readable language-independent IDs.
  - e.g. "GB" -> "united-kingdom", "ES" -> "spain"
  - file-name/git friendly
